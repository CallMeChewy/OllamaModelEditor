# AIDEV-PascalCase Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.2 standard throughout the OllamaModelEditor project, with a particular focus on ensuring the database schema and related components adhere to the standard.

## Goals

1. Ensure complete consistency with the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.2 standard across all components
2. Update the database schema to use PascalCase for all tables and columns
3. Modify all code that interacts with the database to use the new schema
4. Provide migration tools for existing users to update their databases
5. Update documentation to reflect the changes

## Components to Update

### 1. Database Schema

- [x] Create PascalCase database schema (`DatabaseSchema.sql`)
- [x] Update all table names to PascalCase
- [x] Update all column names to PascalCase
- [x] Ensure special terms (API, DB, GUI, etc.) are properly capitalized

### 2. Database Manager

- [x] Update `DBManager.py` to use PascalCase for all database interactions
- [x] Update SQL queries to use PascalCase column names
- [x] Update the default database path to use PascalCase filename

### 3. Configuration Manager

- [x] Update `ConfigManager.py` to work with the PascalCase database schema
- [x] Update methods that interact with the database
- [x] Update the configuration migration logic

### 4. Model Manager

- [ ] Update `ModelManager.py` to work with the PascalCase database schema
- [ ] Update methods that interact with the database
- [ ] Update any SQL queries to use PascalCase column names

### 5. Main Application

- [ ] Update `Main.py` to handle database initialization with the new schema
- [ ] Update command-line arguments for database path if necessary
- [ ] Add support for database migration from snake_case to PascalCase

### 6. GUI Components

- [ ] Update `BenchmarkView.py` to use PascalCase for database interactions
- [ ] Update `ParameterEditor.py` to work with the new schema if it interacts with the database
- [ ] Update any other GUI components that directly interact with the database

### 7. Utility Scripts

- [x] Create a database migration script (`MigrateDBToPascalCase.py`)
- [ ] Update any utility scripts that interact with the database

### 8. Testing

- [ ] Create test cases for the new database schema
- [ ] Test the migration script with different database states
- [ ] Test all components that interact with the database

### 9. Documentation

- [x] Create database migration guide
- [ ] Update general documentation to reflect PascalCase usage
- [ ] Add notes about the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.2 standard in relevant documentation

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Database Components

1. ✅ Create a PascalCase database schema
2. ✅ Update DBManager class to use PascalCase
3. ✅ Create a database migration script
4. ✅ Update ConfigManager to work with the new schema

### Phase 2: Application Logic Components

5. Update ModelManager to work with the new schema
6. Update other core components that interact with the database
7. Test database migrations and functionality

### Phase 3: GUI and Utility Components

8. Update GUI components that interact with the database
9. Update utility scripts to support the new schema
10. Test GUI functionality with the PascalCase database

### Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization

11. ✅ Create documentation for the PascalCase standard implementation
12. Update user guides to reference the new schema
13. Add migration instructions to documentation
14. Perform final comprehensive testing

## Migration Strategy

### For Developers

1. Create a branch for the PascalCase implementation
2. Implement changes in phases as outlined above
3. Create merge requests for each phase
4. Review code changes thoroughly before merging

### For Users

1. Provide a database migration script that:
   - ✅ Backs up the existing database
   - ✅ Creates new tables with PascalCase names
   - ✅ Transfers data from old tables to new ones
   - ✅ Updates any indices or constraints

2. Include clear documentation on how to:
   - Backup existing data
   - Run the migration script
   - Verify successful migration
   - Troubleshoot common issues

## Testing Plan

1. Unit tests for each updated component
2. Integration tests for database interactions
3. Migration tests with various database states:
   - Empty database
   - Database with minimal data
   - Database with substantial data
   - Database with custom user data

4. Edge case testing:
   - Migration failure scenarios
   - Database corruption recovery
   - Concurrent access during migration

## Timeline

- Day 1: Complete Phase 1 (Core Database Components) ✅
- Day 2: Complete Phase 2 (Application Logic Components)
- Day 3: Complete Phase 3 (GUI and Utility Components)
- Day 4: Complete Phase 4 (Documentation and Finalization)
- Day 5: Final testing and refinement

## Potential Challenges

1. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing user databases
   - Solution: Provide comprehensive migration tools and documentation

2. Ensuring all database queries are updated correctly
   - Solution: Thorough testing and code review

3. Handling special case names with acronyms (API, DB, etc.)
   - Solution: Apply consistent rules for special terms as per the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.2 standard

4. Maintaining performance during database migration
   - Solution: Optimize migration script for efficiency with large datasets

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we will fully align the OllamaModelEditor project with the AIDEV-PascalCase-1.2 standard, ensuring a consistent visual fingerprint throughout the codebase and improving the overall coherence and maintainability of the project.

The plan prioritizes the most critical components first, provides comprehensive migration tools for users, and includes thorough testing to ensure a smooth transition to the new standard.
